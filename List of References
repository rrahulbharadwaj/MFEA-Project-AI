We can put in all the references we find for the literature review and choose from that.

Since Prof spoke about goldberg, we shoudl add some of his references and Holland is the pioneer, maybe we could add a base paper for GA. We can also add Dr. Kobti's papers for our work. 

1. (latest reference in paper)[Gupta et al., 2016] Abhishek Gupta, Yew Soon Ong, and Liang Feng. Multifactorial Evolution: Toward Evolutionary Multitasking. IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20(3):343â€“357, 2016.
